"""
Write a class called Rock_paper_scissors that implements the logic of the game Rockpaper-scissors. 
For this game the user plays against the computer for a certain number of rounds. 
Your class should have fields for the how many rounds there will be, 
the current round number, and the number of wins each player has. 
There should be methods for getting the computerâ€™s choice, finding the winner of a round, 
and checking to see if someone has one the (entire) game. 
You may want more methods.
