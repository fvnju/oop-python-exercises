"""
Use the `Standard_deck` class of this section to create a simplified version of the game War.
In this game, there are two players. Each starts with half of a deck.
The players each deal the top card from their decks and
whoever has the higher card wins the other playerâ€™s cards and
adds them to the bottom of his deck. If there is a tie,
the two cards are eliminated from play (this differs from the actual game, but is simpler to program).
The game ends when one player runs out of cards.
